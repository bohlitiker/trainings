## General Information
This repository contains a variety of self-created tutorials for Python in general and certain Python libraries.

Since there are currently only a few tutorials available, there is no proper table of content, but as the number of tutorials increase, it will be added.

More detailed information on each of the topic are available within the according directory.

Ideas, Requests and Constructive Criticism are always welcome.

Please note that since I am new to GitHub, I still have to get used to proper procedures on working collaboratively within GitHub.
